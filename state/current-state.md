## 🔹 Pertti — Supervisory Contracts v1 + Identity Normalization (Checkpoint)

### Status
Pertti supervisory OS contract foundation is now structurally complete (v1) with canonical identity layer integrated.

### Completed

#### 1. Supervisory Contract Stack (v1)

Full end-to-end contract pipeline defined:

- World Model (state → actions → consequences)
- Recommendation Boundary
- Decision Policy Engine
- Execution Routing
- Outcome Ledger
- Learning / Feedback
- Planner
- Project Adapter Resolver
- Role Task Model
- Task Dispatch Boundary
- Supervisory Run Session
- Governance Review / Approval
- Execution Outcome Boundary

System properties:
- fully type-driven
- deterministic
- non-executing (supervisory only)
- audit-first
- proposal → decision → routing → tasking → dispatch → outcome → feedback loop complete

---

#### 2. Canonical Identity Layer (ID-A)

Created:

- src/types/canonicalIds.ts

Defines canonical aliases:
- RecommendationId
- PolicyDecisionId
- RouteId
- TaskId
- DispatchRecordId
- LedgerEntryId
- RunId
- ReviewId
- ExecutionResultId
- PlanId
- PlanStepId
- AdapterId
- ProjectId

Constraint:
- string-based aliases only (no branding yet)

---

#### 3. Identity Normalization Pass — Core (ID-B1)

Normalized:
- recommendation.ts
- decisionPolicy.ts
- executionRouting.ts
- planner.ts (partial, safe scope)
- roleTask.ts
- projectAdapterResolver.ts

Key result:
- core coordination layer now uses canonical IDs
- no architectural changes introduced

---

#### 4. Identity Normalization Pass — Audit / Outcome (ID-B2)

Normalized:
- outcomeLedger.ts
- learningFeedback.ts
- taskDispatch.ts
- supervisoryRunSession.ts
- governanceReview.ts
- executionOutcome.ts

Key result:
- audit, review, and outcome layers now use canonical IDs
- linkage across system is now consistent

---

### Current System Capability

Pertti now supports:

- structured reasoning (World Model)
- controlled decision-making (Policy layer)
- execution abstraction (Routing + Dispatch)
- full audit trail (Ledger + Review)
- feedback loop (Outcome → Feedback)
- planning and coordination (Planner + RoleTask)
- cross-project supervision (Run Session)

System is ready to:

- coordinate multiple projects
- track decisions and outcomes
- support large-scale portfolio supervision
- operate as a deterministic supervisory AI OS

---

### Known Limitations (Intentional)

Not yet implemented:

- envelope-level identity standard
- execution path identity (executionId normalization)
- goal-level identity (GoalId)
- identity branding / opaque types
- runtime engines (all layers are contract-only)
- discovery / opportunity layer

---

### Next Options

1. Envelope Identity Standardization Pack
2. Opportunity Discovery Contracts
3. First runtime adapter layer (very controlled)

Recommended next step:
→ Decide between infra refinement vs capability expansion
